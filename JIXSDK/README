JIXClock SDK
-----------------------------------

JIXSDK allows you to create and test "modes" for the JIXClock directly on your computer, without a physical JIXClock available. Basically, you compile your code with the Makefile, which produces a JIXsimulator executable. Launching JIXsimulator allows you to run your code and observe its behavior in its graphical window.

Requirements
------------------------------

- GCC or clang compiler (tested with clang 3.3)
- GNU Make
- SDL (tested with 1.2.15). The sdl-config executable must be accessible with your PATH environment variable.

Creating/compiling a new mode
------------------------------

To create a new mode, open the Arduino application, then the "JIXos.ino" file (which will all related files ("tabs"). Create a new tab for .h, new tab for .cpp and write your code (see instructions in the JIXos README file).
Then add the your new source file (xxx.cpp) in the Makefile of JIXSDK (ARDUINOCPP variable) and type make. The JIXsimulator executable is produced at the end of the build process.

Using the buttons
------------------------------

The buttons are emulated through the keyboard. 
Key "m" is for the "mode" button,
Key "i" is for the "increment" button.

Limitations
------------------------------

Setting the hour manually with the buttons is not very well supported (it is possible to cycle through the settings, but the increment button will have no effect for now).

LEDs display takes into account the luminosity, but the result is not very realistic (too dim).
 
Only a subset of the Arduino functions is implemented for now (random, etc.). You can add new function's implementation by modifying the files in the src directory. AVRCompat.h should contain the prototype of the function (the file is included when compiling the Arduino files), and JIXMain.cpp contains the implementation.
