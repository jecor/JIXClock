JIXClock SDK
-----------------------------------

JIXSDK allows you to create and test "modes" for the JIXClock directly on your computer, without a physical JIXClock available. Basically, you compile your code with the Makefile, which produces a JIXsimulator executable. Launching JIXsimulator allows you to run your code and observe its behavior in its graphical window.

Requirements
------------------------------

- GCC compiler (tested with GCC 4.2.1)
- GNU Make
- SDL (tested with 1.2.15). The sdl-config executable must be accessible with your PATH environment variable.
- Java (tested with 1.6)
- Java Compiler

Creating/compiling a new mode
------------------------------

To create a new mode, open the Arduino application, then the "JIXos.ino" file (which will all related files ("tabs"). Create a new tab and write your code (see instructions in the JIXos README file).
Then add the your new file (xxx.ino) in the Makefile of JIXSDK (ARDUINOFILES variable) and type make. The JIXsimulator executable is produced at the end of the build process.

Using the buttons
------------------------------

The buttons are emulated through the keyboard. 
Key "m" is for the "mode" button,
Key "i" is for the "increment" button.

Limitations
------------------------------

Setting the hour manually with the buttons is not very well supported (it is possible to cycle through the settings, but the increment button will have no effect for now).

The RTC memory is not supported (luminosity is not remembered from one run to the other).

LEDs display takes into account the luminosity, but the result is not very realistic (too dim).
 
Only a subset of the Arduino functions is implemented for now (random, etc.). You can add new function's implementation by modifying the files in the src directory. AVRCompat.h should contain the prototype of the function (the file is included when compiling the Arduino files), and JIXMain.cpp contains the implementation.
